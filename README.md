#OTIM builder

Compiles all repositories configured for OTIM. This is a fork of [aslushnikov/latex-online](https://github.com/aslushnikov/latex-online), adding new build scripts.

## Development

One needs to populate `s3creds` with either access details to your own bucket, or if you want to work on OTIM, @jakebian is happy to provide the credentials.
